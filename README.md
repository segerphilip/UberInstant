UberInstant
----------------

A project for HackHolyoke Spring 2015.

We developed a physical interface for Uber that will call a car given your choice of destination through voice recognition. We utilized an LCD display, physical buttons, and an Arduino, which connect to a computer. The device then displays your destination, type of Uber, estimated wait time, and estimated price. We wrote the backend in Python leveraging the powerful Uber and Google Voice APIs. We believe Uber Instant would be useful in many applications.
